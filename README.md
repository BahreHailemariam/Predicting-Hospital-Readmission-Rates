# 🏥 Predicting Hospital Readmission Rates
*A machine learning–powered healthcare analytics project to identify patients at high risk of being readmitted after discharge.*

---
## 📘 Overview
Hospital readmissions are a critical healthcare metric that affects patient care quality and hospital performance. This project builds a **predictive analytics system** that uses **machine learning** to forecast which patients are most likely to be readmitted within 30 days of discharge.

By leveraging **electronic health record (EHR)** data and other patient-level attributes, this solution helps healthcare providers proactively design interventions, improve outcomes, and optimize hospital resources.

---
## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify factors contributing to frequent hospital readmissions.
- Develop a **predictive model** for readmission risk using historical EHR data.
- Create actionable insights for **care management teams** to reduce preventable readmissions.
- Build a **Power BI dashboard** for real-time visualization and operational monitoring.

---
## 🧩 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handles missing data, outliers, and categorical encodings.
- **Feature Engineering:** Derives new variables such as *comorbidity index*, *length of stay*, and *follow-up compliance*.
- **Modeling:** Implements ML models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix visualizations.
- **Deployment:** Interactive dashboard and model API integration for ongoing hospital use.

## 🩺 1. Readmission Overview

**Objective:**  
Provide a high-level snapshot of hospital performance and patient readmission patterns.

**Visual Components:**
- KPI Cards: 30-Day Readmission Rate, Average Cost per Readmission, Average Length of Stay, Department-wise Readmission Rate
- Trend Line: Monthly readmission rate over time
- Stacked Bar Chart: Department-wise readmission distribution
- Heatmap: Readmission frequency by diagnosis category and age group
- Filters: Department, Diagnosis Group, Month, Insurance Type

**Example DAX Measures:**
```DAX
Readmission Rate (%) =
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER('Patients', 'Patients'[Readmitted] = 1)),
    COUNTROWS('Patients')
) * 100

Avg Cost per Readmission =
AVERAGE('Patients'[ReadmissionCost])
```

**Business Questions Answered:**
- Which departments have the highest readmission rates?
- Are readmission costs increasing over time?
- What seasonal or temporal patterns exist?

---
## 🧠 2. Patient Risk Profiling

**Objective:**  
Segment and visualize patients by predicted readmission risk levels (Low, Medium, High).

**Visual Components:**
- Scatter Plot: Risk Score vs. Age, colored by risk group
- Table: Patient ID, Age, Diagnosis, Predicted Probability, Risk Category
- Donut Chart: Proportion of patients by risk group
- Histogram: Distribution of predicted probabilities
- KPI Card: Count of High-Risk Patients

**Example DAX Measures:**
```DAX
High Risk Patients =
COUNTROWS(FILTER('Predictions', 'Predictions'[RiskScore] > 0.7))

Avg Risk Score =
AVERAGE('Predictions'[RiskScore])
```

**Business Questions Answered:**
- Which patients are most likely to be readmitted?
- How can care teams prioritize interventions?
- How many high-risk patients were discharged recently?

---

## 🧮 3. Model Insights

**Objective:**  
Provide interpretability and validation of the machine learning model.

**Visual Components:**
- Bar Chart: Top 10 features influencing predictions
- ROC Curve: Model performance comparison (Train vs Validation)
- Confusion Matrix: Model prediction breakdown
- KPI Cards: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC
- Line Chart: Accuracy trend across retraining cycles

**Example DAX Measure:**
```DAX
Model Accuracy (%) =
DIVIDE(SUM('Metrics'[Correct Predictions]), SUM('Metrics'[Total Predictions])) * 100
```

**Business Questions Answered:**
- How accurate is the model?
- Which features most influence predictions?
- Is model performance consistent across demographics?

---
## ⚙️ 4. Operational Metrics

**Objective:**  
Enable management to monitor interventions, care programs, and outcomes.

**Visual Components:**
- Gauge Chart: Target vs Actual Readmission Reduction (%)
- Table: Intervention summary (Patient ID, Type, Follow-Up Date, Clinician)
- Bar Chart: Average intervention effectiveness
- Line Chart: Weekly improvement trends
- Map: Readmission density by region (multi-site)

**Example DAX Measure:**
```DAX
Reduction from Baseline (%) =
DIVIDE(
    [Baseline Readmission Rate] - [Current Readmission Rate],
    [Baseline Readmission Rate]
) * 100
```

**Business Questions Answered:**
- Are intervention programs effective?
- Which care strategies yield the best outcomes?
- How do results vary across regions?
