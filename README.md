# 🏥 Predicting Hospital Readmission Rates
*A machine learning–powered healthcare analytics project to identify patients at high risk of being readmitted after discharge.*

---
## 📘 Overview
Hospital readmissions are a critical healthcare metric that affects patient care quality and hospital performance. This project builds a **predictive analytics system** that uses **machine learning** to forecast which patients are most likely to be readmitted within 30 days of discharge.

By leveraging **electronic health record (EHR)** data and other patient-level attributes, this solution helps healthcare providers proactively design interventions, improve outcomes, and optimize hospital resources.

---
## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify factors contributing to frequent hospital readmissions.
- Develop a **predictive model** for readmission risk using historical EHR data.
- Create actionable insights for **care management teams** to reduce preventable readmissions.
- Build a **Power BI dashboard** for real-time visualization and operational monitoring.

---
## 🧩 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handles missing data, outliers, and categorical encodings.
- **Feature Engineering:** Derives new variables such as *comorbidity index*, *length of stay*, and *follow-up compliance*.
- **Modeling:** Implements ML models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix visualizations.
- **Deployment:** Interactive dashboard and model API integration for ongoing hospital use.
